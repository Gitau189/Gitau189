## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I'm a data enthusiast studying Data Science and Analytics at the United States International University .I am kenyan 
 I love using code (think Python and R) to bring ideas to life, and data analysis (think spreadsheets!) helps me uncover hidden stories within information.  I want to use data science to make a real difference in the world. As an aspiring entrepreneur with a problem-solving spirit, I'm always looking for ways to use my skills for good.
